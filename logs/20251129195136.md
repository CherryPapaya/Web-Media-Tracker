### Goal/s
- [x] Get a basic idea of the script for the modifying of the list using NodeJS

### General
- Learned a bit about NodeJS filesystem, path, and async vs sync.
- Resources:
  - [Java Async Await and Promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li7FzDHYZpc)
  - [Read/Write JSON Files with NodeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrjC6RwEpt0)
  - [Read/Write Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQBw8skBdZU)

### Problems
- When making a fileReader function that should return the file's data as a JSON object, the asynchronous nature of NodeJS would prevent anything from being returned at all.
  - Solution/s:
    - Use a callback as seen in the second resource (no, thanks).
    - Turn it into an async function and use "await" to ensure that the file reading will be completed before moving on.
    - ```html
      (async () => {
        const list = await fileReader(filePath);
        console.log(list);
      })();

      async function fileReader(filePath) {
          try {
              const jsonString = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
              return JSON.parse(jsonString)
          } catch (error) {
              console.log('Error: ' + error);
          }
      }
