### Goal/s
- [x] Form handling and saving fr fr this time

### General
I caved. After getting confused by YouTube tuts about Express I have decided to ask ChatGPT. I did not simply ask for a copy paste code for this project specifically and end it there. No, I do actually want to learn this shit. I just asked about form-handling in general. And finally, it clicked. I vaguely understand routes now. I understand how to handle forms. I understand serving files.

Of course, I would not have understood it the way I did from GPT if not for the foundational basis provided by the YouTube tuts (thanks WittCode and Web Dev Simplified).

I will practice more and learn more to truly understand more about Express (sessions and stuff) and the backend. But for now, I understand enough for this project with some guidance and refreshers from time to time.

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH IT WORKS IT WORKS IT WORKS IT WORKS AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

### Problem/s
- It didn't submit the form did nothing.
  - The type attribute of the submit was set to "button". Setting it to "submit" fixed it.
