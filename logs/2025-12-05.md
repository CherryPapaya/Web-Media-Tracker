### Goal/s
- [ ] Simple form validation
- [ ] Update and delete entries

### General
Got too distracted by GUI. Instead started working on EJS.

### Problem/s
- Alignment of Year and Type labels were weird (too far to the left of the fields).
  - Solution: Separate the "form-floating" and "col-n" class names.
