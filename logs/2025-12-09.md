### Goal/s
- [ ] Simple form validation
- [x] Update entries
- [x] Delete entries

### General
Also added entry pages

### Problem/s
- clicking the edit buttons wouldn't work
  - Solution: form action for edit.ejs should have variable: action="/edit/<%= entry.id>"
- Using id for edit wouldn't work.
  - Solution: in '/edit/:id' route, numberfy it: const id = Number(req.params.id);
- type becomes undefined when editing and not setting it.
  - solution: remove "hidden" and "disabled" attributes from select in edit.ejs.
- delete route not wokring
  - solution: decided to just use post. I'll learn delete (and put) some other time.
