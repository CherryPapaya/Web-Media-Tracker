### Goal/s
- [ ] Simple form validation
- [x] Update entries



### Problem/s
- clicking the edit buttons wouldn't work
  - Solution: form action for edit.ejs should have variable: action="/edit/<%= entry.id>"
- Using id for edit wouldn't work.
  - Solution: in '/edit/:id' route, numberfy it: const id = Number(req.params.id);
