### Goal/s
- [x] Basic HTML Structure of homepage

### General
Feeling inspired by some of those sleek modern UIs with big central text/logo on the cover page.
No specific reference for now, but [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com) is a great source for general inspo.

Ended up also starting layout using Bootstrap.

### Problems
- Centering small columns while controlling gap in between.
  Solution:
  ``` html
<div class="row justify-content-center column-gap-2">
	<button class="col-2"></button>
      <button class="col-2"></button>
</div>
```

### Notes
- Use Bootstrap mainly for layout, basic components, and one-use styles. Do NOT clutter HTML with too many class names from bootstrap for repetitive custom styling.
